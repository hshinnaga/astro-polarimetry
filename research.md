# Research Projects

We explore the mysteries of the Universe, focusing on star formation and evolution, the interstellar medium, and the roles of the magnetic field in our Milkyway Galaxy to understand how the magnetic field shapes our  Galaxy, mainly using world-class radio telescopes.

## 1. Magnetic Fields in Star Forming Regions
Stars are born in dense molecular clouds, and magnetic fields play a crucial role in their evolution. Using **astro-polarimetry**, we visualize the "invisible" magnetic field lines.

* **Key Finding:** Our observations revealed that magnetic fields are surprisingly well-ordered even in turbulent environments.
* **Telescopes Used:** ALMA, JCMT (POL-2).

## 2. High-Resolution Observations with ALMA, VLA, VERA
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allows us to zoom in on the very heart of stars that are just before supernova explosions.

    <strong>Dynamics of Protostellar Disks</strong><br>
    We study the gas dynamics and dust distribution around young stars to understand how planetary systems (like our Solar System) are formed.

## 3. Roles of Magnetic Field of mass accretion onto the Super Massive Black Hole (Sgr A*) at the heart of our Milkyway Galaxy
Using JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 submillimeter polarization techniques, we measure the 3D structure of the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) of surrounding Sgr A* by comparing with a self-similar accregion disk model.

* **Mission:** To create a 3D map of the Milky Way.
* **Focus:** Exploring the high-mass star-forming regions in the spiral arms.
